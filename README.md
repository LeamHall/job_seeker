# job_seeker

Tracks job applications and contacts


## Logic

- Given -r `req number>`, print out that job request
- Given -p `POC name>`, prints out that Point of Contact
- Given -a, and -r or -p, and data, adds to the end of the file
- Given -r or -p, and -s `string`, searches the relevant file and prints 
    any job or poc that matches `string`
- - An empty `string` prints all jobs or pocs
- - Not really going to use wildcards or regexs yet
